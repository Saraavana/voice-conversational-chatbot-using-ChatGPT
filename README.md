# Voice and text based conversational chatbot using ChatGPT

## Features:

1. Text-Based Interaction: Users can chat with the chatbot using text messages. The chatbot will process the user's input, analyze it using ChatGPT, and generate appropriate responses, making the conversation feel as natural as possible.
2. Voice-Based Interaction: The chatbot will also support voice-based interaction, allowing users to communicate with it through voice commands. This feature enhances accessibility and provides a more hands-free user experience.
3. Natural Language Understanding: The chatbot will be equipped with natural language understanding capabilities to interpret user queries accurately. It will be able to handle a wide range of topics and respond intelligently.
4. Contextual Conversations: To ensure coherent and contextually relevant conversations, the chatbot will maintain contextual information across interactions. This enables more fluid and seamless communication with the user.
5. Personalization: The chatbot will learn from user interactions to offer personalized responses. As users engage with the chatbot over time, it will adapt its replies to align better with individual preferences.
6. Error Handling: Robust error handling mechanisms will be implemented to handle out-of-scope queries and provide informative error messages when necessary.
7. History: Maintain the history of all the chat interactations.
